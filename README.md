# C# Calculator

This is a simple calculator that I learned the basics of through a course, and I enhanced it with my knowledge of C#. This marks my thirteenth day studying C#.

## 🚀 Starting

Here will be a series of instructions for anyone who wants to run my code. Even though it's something simple, I want to practice creating more complex documentation.

### 📋 Pré-requirements

• .NET 6 or Higher

• Any code editor or an IDE.

• I recommend using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code with the C# extension.

### 🔧 Install

Diga como essa etapa será:

```
git clone https://github.com/dbdev8000/Calculator-Csharp.git
```

### ⚙️ Open the project and execute:

```
dotnet run
```
